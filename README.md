# .Net_Core_IdentityServer4_Connection_Starter
.Net Core IdentityServer4 Connection Starter

In this solution, we are going to user IdentityServer4 with ASP.net Core. Three projects are created: IdentityServer Server, API Server and Client Console.
Clinent Console will call Identity Server to get the token, which used to talk with API server. 

For the detail information about this project, please check with my blog post :ã€€[https://www.starwar.io/wp-admin/post.php?post=343&action=edit](https://www.starwar.io/blog/2017/04/23/creating-asp-net-core-identity-identityserver4)

**In order to run this solution in your local, please read my post to modify the localhost port number for API Server and Identity Server.**
